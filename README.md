# Modified-CSR-based-Sparse-matrix-Vector-Multliplication

This project is done as a part of semester course "System Design with FPGA".

The modified CSR implementation is compared with CSR implementation and Redundant modified COO implemetation.

The codes and coe files used for the project are attached in this repository.
